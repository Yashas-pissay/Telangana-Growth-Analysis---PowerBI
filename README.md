## Project Overview

Telangana is one of the fastest-growing states in India, and it has an open data policy. This means that all of the state's data is published online, making it easy to analyze and identify trends.

Our stakeholders wanted us to analyze Telangana's growth among different sectors quantitatively and provide useful insights to the Telangana government. This would help them to make data-informed decisions that would further support the growth of the state.

## Tools Used:
  * Excel: To prepare the data for analysis, we used Excel to clean and organize it.

  * Power BI: Using the powerful data analysis tool Power BI, we were able to quantitatively analyze Telangana's growth among different sectors and provide useful insights to the Telangana government.

  * ChatGPT and Google: I used ChatGPT and Google to help us with our research and analysis.

# Objective:
* Explore Stamp Registration, Transportation and Ts-Ipass datasets. Understand their attributes, categories and time period.
* Analyze trends and patterns within each department.
* Identify growth opportunities and areas needing attention.
* Find correlation among these departments and report the overall growth of the state through insights and relevant visuals such as shape maps.

## Top Insight:
1.  After the implementation of e-stamp, it can be clearly seen that the number of e-stamp has increased. The number of document registrations has also increased, but not as significantly as the number of e-Stamp challans.

2. These are the top 4 districts where maximum revenue is generated, maximum vehicle sales , maximum employment generated  and maximum investment has taken place.
      * Rangareddy
      * Medchal_Malkajgiri
      * Hyderabad
      * Sangareddy

3. After analysis, I found that across Telangana, most people like to buy motorbikes, followed by motorcars, agriculture vehicle, autorickshaw.

4. The fuel type vehicle sales of petrol and diesel have been highest in the month of October and June. Similarly, for electric type and other fuel types, the sales have been highest in the month of March.

5. I found that in all over Telangana Nalgonda, Suryapet, Siddipet and Khamam districts have the highest sales of agriculture related vehicles. This makes it possible to say that is agriculture dominated district.

6. Real Estate, Industrial Parks and It Building , Pharmaceuticals and chemicals, Plastics and Rubber , Solar and Other Renewable Energy and Bevrage Sector have highest investments in past 5 fives years.

7. In general, districts with higher vehicle sales also have higher investments and higher stamps revenue. However, there are some exceptions to this rule. For example, Hyderabad is a district with high vehicle sales but low investment.

## Insight Conclusion:

1. Telangana is a major hub for IT and IT-enabled services (ITES). The state is home to over 1,500 IT and ITES companies, which employ ove 6 lakh people.

2. Telangana is also a major hub for manufacturing. The state is home to a number of large-scale manufacturing industries, such as automobiles, pharmaceuticals, and electronics.

3. Telangana has a young and educated population. The state's literacy rate is over 70%, and the median age is 27 years.

4. Telangana has a favorable investment climate. The state government has implemented a number of policies and initiatives to attract investment, such as TS-iPASS and e-stamping.

5. Telangana is well-positioned to benefit from the growing global demand for sustainable products and services. The state has a number of natural resources, such as solar and wind energy, that can be used to produce sustainable energy.

6. Telangana is a major tourist destination. The state is home to a number of historical and cultural attractions, such as the Charminar and Golconda Fort, etc.

## Recomendation:
1. After the implementation of e-stamp, it can be clearly seen that the number of e-stamp has increased. But the government should focus more on e-STMAP challan so that the number of document registered challans can not be reduced. Because they are still using more than people document registration.

2. Telangana is a large state with 31 districts, of which 𝟭𝟬 𝗮𝗿𝗲 𝗿𝘂𝗿𝗮𝗹 𝗱𝗶𝘀𝘁𝗿𝗶𝗰𝘁𝘀. The population living in these districts accounts for about 40% of the state's total population. To promote development in rural districts, the Telangana government should take the following measures:
      * Improve infrastructure: Rural districts lack roads, electricity, water, and other basic infrastructure. Improving this infrastructure will boost development in rural areas.
      * Improve education and healthcare: The quality of education and healthcare in rural districts needs to be improved. This will improve the standard of living of people in rural areas.
      * Create employment opportunities: There is a lack of employment opportunities in rural districts. The government should create employment opportunities in the agriculture, industry, and service sectors in rural areas.
      * Implement rural development programs: The government should implement various programs for rural development, such as the :
         * 𝗥𝘂𝗿𝗮𝗹 𝗗𝗲𝘃𝗲𝗹𝗼𝗽𝗺𝗲𝗻𝘁 𝗦𝗰𝗵𝗲𝗺𝗲, 
         * 𝗡𝗮𝘁𝗶𝗼𝗻𝗮𝗹 𝗥𝘂𝗿𝗮𝗹 𝗘𝗺𝗽𝗹𝗼𝘆𝗺𝗲𝗻𝘁 𝗚𝘂𝗮𝗿𝗮𝗻𝘁𝗲𝗲 𝗦𝗰𝗵𝗲𝗺𝗲 
         * 𝗣𝗿𝗮𝗱𝗵𝗮𝗻 𝗠𝗮𝗻𝘁𝗿𝗶 𝗔𝘄𝗮𝘀 𝗬𝗼𝗷𝗮𝗻𝗮.
